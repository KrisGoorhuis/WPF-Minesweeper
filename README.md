##  What is this?
A full replication of the classic desktop game in C# and Windows Presentation Foundation. Features customizable area and mine density, flagging, and custom ASCII art.

## What was it built with?
C# and Windows Presentation Foundation. Part of the intent was to explore what standard software development might be like.

## Additional Details
This began as a multiplayer project, but it seems Windows Presentation Foundation may not be ideal for live multiplayer gaming. Go figure.
Those pieces have been stripped out and this repository should be fairly clean. You can find loose ends and abandoned exploration elsewhere if you're interested.
